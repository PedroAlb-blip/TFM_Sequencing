#### This file will take the values stored from parser.py and produce the correction 
#### IDEAS:
#### 1.- Look for local peaks and produce a list containing them (all of them)
#### 2.- Cross check the PLOC lists of both forward and reverse
#### These should provide useful data regarding non-aligned regions
#### For aligned regions:
#### 1.- Eliminate insertions by cross checking the local peak list
#### 2.- Wherever there is a mismatch do the sum of channels and verify the nucleotide in either forward or reverse
#### 3.- Alter the forward and reverse sequence and make a new alignment
